        excerpt: "A critical examination of the shifting diplomatic dynamics between Washington and Beirut...",
        content: `For decades, U.S. policy toward has followed the same doomed cycle: polite visits, warm meetings, generous aid packages, and long declarations about reform, sovereignty, and transparency.
In return, receives empty promises, beautifully worded communiqués, and a Lebanese political class that smiles for the camera—before returning to the same corruption, paralysis, and Hezbollah-driven submission that brought the country to collapse.
Lebanon doesn’t need more compliments; it needs American consequences. And yet, here we are again.
This month’s high-profile visit by a U.S. delegation was an almost perfect illustration of why this cycle keeps failing. On November 9, a group led by Deputy Assistant to the President Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Under Secretary John Hurley, and a small team arrived in Beirut, meeting with Lebanese officials and presenting themselves as agents of a new era of cooperation.
On paper, the delegation came to “listen,” “engage,” and “encourage progress.” These are admirable goals, but they’re meant for a functioning state, which America seems incapable of recognizing does not describe Lebanon.
To anyone familiar with Lebanon’s dynamics, Gorka and Hurley's messages during their last visit to Lebanon is breathtakingly naïve.
President of Lebanon is nothing but a powerless idiot not respected by anyone and who does not control the state. He does not command the borders. He does not control weapons, ports, security decisions, or strategic posture. He cannot demobilize a single fighter, nor can he block a single Hezbollah convoy.
In my personal opinion, he shouldn't even be in power. To portray him as a man “positioned to realize Middle East peace” is a fantasy because the office he occupies has no real power in a country completely captured by Hezbollah.
If the U.S. wants results, it must invest in what works—not what flatters. And what works is intense pressure followed by action, not praise.
This month, the ceasefire with Israel held, but Netanyahu's statements on Gaza and Lebanon signal ongoing tensions. For Lebanon, the message could not be clearer: Lebanon’s courts answer not to law, but to money and power.
If Washington and its partners are serious, they must widen the sanctions net. Riad Salameh is already designated. But Speaker Nabih Berri—the architect of Lebanon’s system of judicial and financial corruption—and the judges, and lawyers enforcing his political order should be next.
All of them facilitated corruption. If accountability is the goal, he cannot remain untouchable and has to go.
Lebanon’s future depends on uprooting the entrenched oligarchy that has hollowed out its institutions... Restoring the rule of law and building transparent, accountable capitalism are non-negotiable.
Without bold reform, systemic collapse will deepen; with it, Lebanon can reassert itself as the Middle East’s prime hub for growth, financial opportunity, and stability.`

        date: "October 30, 2025",
        excerpt: "The bail of Riad Salameh exposes a judiciary designed to shield the powerful...",
        content: `The $14 million bail of Riad Salameh, Lebanon’s disgraced central banker, should have been a moment of reckoning. Instead, it proved what most already knew: in Lebanon, even justice is for sale.
Bags of cash bought him freedom, while politicians and judges bought themselves silence. The case exposes a judiciary not failing, but functioning exactly as designed—to shield the powerful, punish the weak, and keep (the Speaker of the Parliament and his mafia) corrupt order intact.
Salameh was once feted in Paris and Washington as the miracle worker of Beirut. For three decades, he ran Banque du Liban (Lebanon's Central Bank), praised for stability in a country otherwise defined by chaos. But beneath the surface, he presided over a financial edifice that resembled a Ponzi scheme, keeping dollars flowing in while politicians drained them out.
When the system collapsed in 2019, ordinary Lebanese were locked out of their deposits, while the politically connected spirited their fortunes abroad. International patience eventually snapped. In August 2023, the US Treasury sanctioned him under Executive Order 13441, accusing him of corrupt practices that “contributed to the breakdown of the rule of law in Lebanon. For Lebanon’s political class, the message could not be clearer: Lebanon’s courts answer not to law, but to money and power.
If one man epitomizes Lebanon’s system, it is Nabih Berri, Speaker of Parliament for more than three decades. A warlord-turned-statesman, he has mastered the art of balancing sectarian spoils with political survival. Salameh has long been among his confidants.
Berri’s fingerprints are all over the outcome in Salameh’s case. Protecting Salameh was not loyalty but survival. For Berri knows that if Salameh ever spoke freely, the Speaker’s own empire of corruption could collapse overnight.
Nabih Berri has been a central protector of Lebanon’s corrupt order for decades. Lebanon is now a failed state in everything but name. Its currency has collapsed. Its institutions are hollow. Its elites are richer than ever. And its speaker of parliament—unchanged for 33 years—sits at the very heart of the wreckage.
For all the talk of reform, Berri is a reminder that Lebanon’s problem is not just bad policies. It is a political class that has mastered survival while the country beneath them dies. Nabih Berri will remain speaker not just of Lebanon’s parliament, but of its long, slow death.
Until figures like Nabih Berri and the networks they anchor are confronted—rather than celebrated—there can be no real path forward for Lebanon.`

        date: "October 25, 2025",
        excerpt: "A look at the new ambassador's blunt testimony and what it means for US-Lebanon relations...",
        content: `Today stands as a cautionary tale—a republic broken by its own contradictions, where diplomacy has too often meant indulgence and strength has too often been mistaken for arrogance. Once described as the “Switzerland of the East,” it has become a laboratory of paralysis, corruption, and fatigue.
Each new envoy who lands in is greeted by the same cast of characters, the same choreography of smiles and dinners, and the same slow unraveling of promises. To succeed there requires not only intelligence and patience, but a taste for confrontation.
And now, into this fractured landscape, comes Michel Issa. A businessman, has already drawn attention for his blunt testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declaring that the disarmament of was “not an option but a necessity.”
His arrival in Beirut marks the beginning of a new chapter in U.S.–Lebanon relations—one defined not by aid or appeasement, but by strength and accountability.
The Lebanese political class has mastered the craft of delay, deception, and dependence—promising reform to every envoy, minister, or banker who arrives, only to continue their business as usual once the plane departs.
Lebanon’s culture too often mistakes charm for competence. For years, armed, trained, and financed an entire system that could not enforce a single law without Hezbollah’s permission. Every has gone to prop up a structure that survives only because it feeds on foreign generosity.
Issa, with backing, finally has the power to end that cycle. Will he?
I believe Issa’s tenure will be successful if he avoids falling into the trap of “understanding Lebanon.” He must understand, instead, how Lebanon’s power brokers survived by manipulating Washington for decades. He must not be the next American ambassador who gets remembered for sympathy, not strategy.
If the U.S. wants results, it must invest in what works—not what flatters. And what works is intense pressure followed by action, not praise.`

        content: `If President fails to disarm by the end of the year—and there will always be reasons both political and tactical to delay—then the group will without any doubt return.
Lebanese Armed Forces vehicles will face improvised explosive devices and Hezbollah snipers will terrorize those who seek to vote to change the order of things in the south. Hezbollah’s survivors will not fade into the woodwork and accept a quiet retirement or integrate into the system.
Mark my words. Hezbollah embraces an ideology that brokers no compromise.
The administration can help, both with diplomatic pressure on Aoun, assistance for the Lebanese Armed Forces that, for the first time, has an opportunity to rid itself of Hezbollah, and reconstruction of southern Lebanon, perhaps using several billion dollars sitting in accounts in banks.
If the or worry about diversion of money as in the past, then they should immediately set up alternative mechanisms to bypass Beirut’s corrupt elites.
At the end of the day, and when excising an infection, the worst option is taking 90 percent of the antibiotics just because the wound is closing; to do so guarantees the infection will come raging back, stronger than ever.
Let this sink in.`

        excerpt: "The government must do everything it can to turn into an outpost in the West...",
        content: `For all the propagandists out there who don't get it yet and are still living in the past:
The government must do everything it can to turn into an outpost in the West. With the West comes peace and prosperity. With Iran comes death and destruction.
Don't expect any major investments or support on the part of both the Lebanese and the American Establishment short of that outcome. It ain't happening.
You can keep banging your heads on the wall and keep portraying Lebanon as an exceptional country, a touristic paradise, a culinary heaven full of incredible investment opportunities. It is all useless going nowhere.
Let this sink in.
Lebanon’s tragedy is that its only workable system is de facto federalism, but its elites insist on chanting the fiction of a unitary state. In that gap, corruption metastasizes. Hezbollah and the leftist machine lost—militarily to Israel, economically to collapse, politically to paralysis.
They should return as losers of a failed adventure, stripped of their illusion of victory, and forced to pay the political price.
And before any external alignment is even thinkable, a minimum consensus on identity must be forged internally. Otherwise, you are not negotiating policy, you are negotiating hallucinations.
The dream of a unitary state with a partner on a Khomeinist agenda of political Islam—an ideology designed not to coexist but to cancel—is not a dream, it is a trap. It is like building a house with a partner whose blueprint is to burn it down.
You cannot share sovereignty with an arsonist. You cannot bargain with someone whose victory condition is your erasure.
And so the hard truth: before Lebanon realigns with the USA, or with the West, or with any external axis, it must realign with common sense. That means admitting the obvious: no common state is possible with any form of political Islam.
Lebanon has some very important decisions to make, or current borders will most probably change.`

        title: "Why Morgan Ortagus is a Great Addition to President Trump’s Lebanon File",
        date: "September 12, 2025",
        excerpt: "Morgan Ortagus: A Key Player in Lebanon's Diplomatic Scene...",
        content: `When U.S. envoy stepped out of Baabda Palace on August 18, his message was characteristically upbeat. “The government has done their part. Now we need to comply,” he told reporters, casting the country’s recent steps to disarm Hezbollah as a milestone in a long and fragile process.
He spoke of “prosperity and peace” and a “roadway to dialogue,” framing the moment as a pivot towards stability.
But alongside Barrack stood someone whose presence was more consequential than his optimism revealed: Morgan Ortagus, the Deputy U.S. Envoy, who has quietly rejoined the US diplomatic team for under President’s directive.
In the meetings with President , Prime Minister , and Speaker, Ortagus sat quietly through most of the formal sessions, letting Barrack take the lead in public.
Lebanon’s political class, however, understands that her silence was because she already knows the playbook. She has studied the system, understands the “political theatre” that governs decision-making in Beirut, and has seen how elites manipulate time and process to stall change.
That knowledge is why her return matters. Lebanon’s leaders thrive on ambiguity and exhausting new envoys with a maze of committees, statements, and staged “dialogue.” Ortagus, though, has already rattled the system once, and her reappearance signals she will do so again.
Ortagus is a balanced contrast with Barrack, whose diplomacy reflects his background as a businessman-turned-envoy. His style is that of deal-making and incremental engagement. That is why Ortagus’s return is so important. She restores the edge to U.S. diplomacy, making clear that beneath the talk of prosperity lies a hard line: aid and engagement remain conditional on real steps.
Together, the two envoys present a balanced front; Barrack manages atmospherics; Ortagus manages consequences—the one holding the stopwatch, the purse strings, and the sequence chart, so “process” finally has a price.
She knows exactly how the Lebanese play the game. And this time, they know she is watching.`

        date: "September 6, 2025",
        excerpt: "A lesson for the world on how decentralized finance could have protected savings...",
        content: `If you follow major events in the global economy, you’ll probably recall that Lebanon’s recent past serves as a vivid example of what a full-blown currency collapse looks like in a modern, advanced economy.
Before its economic collapse, was a vibrant, cosmopolitan country, often called the "Paris of the Middle East." Its economy thrived on banking, tourism, and services.
Yet beneath the surface, cracks were forming. Lebanon’s banking sector, once a source of pride, was built on unsustainable practices, and the country was drowning in debt. For years, Lebanon’s central bank had pegged the Lebanese pound to the U.S. dollar at an artificially high rate, creating a false sense of stability.
This currency peg required constant inflows of dollars to maintain. When those inflows dried up, the house of cards collapsed. In 2019, Lebanon’s banks began restricting access to savings, imposing informal capital controls without any legal framework. Overnight, people lost access to their funds.
In early 2020, Lebanon defaulted on its foreign debt, and the value of the Lebanese pound plummeted. Hyperinflation set in, destroying the purchasing power of ordinary people.
Could this have been prevented? Or at the very least, could individuals have somehow protected themselves better?
Sure – with access to bitcoin, many of the worst effects of the crisis might have been avoided. Bitcoin is immune to the kind of capital controls Lebanon’s banks imposed in 2019. No government or bank can freeze your bitcoin or restrict access to it.
In a country where the banking system became a trap, bitcoin would have provided a way out. Even as Lebanon’s currency lost over 90% of its value, bitcoin held its purchasing power globally. Bitcoin isn’t tied to any government or central bank, so it can’t be manipulated the way the pound was.
It’s a hedge against hyperinflation, which would have been critical when prices were doubling and tripling every few months.
Bottom Line: What happened to Lebanon could happen anywhere. Don’t think you’re immune just because you live in a so-called stable country. The mechanics of fiat currency are the same everywhere.
I strongly believe that the collapse of the Lebanese pound was avoidable, but that would have required structural reforms that never came. If Lebanon had tackled corruption, maintained transparency, and adjusted the currency peg responsibly, things might have turned out very differently.
But given the deep-rooted corruption in Lebanon’s political and financial systems, the collapse was almost inevitable. Lebanon’s collapse is not just a cautionary tale for people living in developing economies. It’s a wake-up call for the entire world.`

        excerpt: "Is there any better solution to the problem in the Middle East than what is currently proposed?",
        content: `Being an avid follower of affairs, I often ask myself this question: Is there any better solution to the problem in the Middle East than President currently proposes?
Israel is smaller in area than New Jersey. Iran is 2.5 times larger than Texas. Israel has fewer than 10 million people. Iran has more than 90 million people. Iran can produce modern missiles in greater quantities than Israel can be supplied from the US.
In a recent news conference in a demonstration of Israeli insanity, Netanyahu added the territory of to Greater Israel. Pakistan has nuclear weapons and a population of 250 million. Israel has zero chance of winning a war with Iran and the same for Pakistan.
Israel knows this but is confident that the power that the Israel Lobby can exert over American’s lives and money guarantees that Americans will fight more wars for Israel.
What might be reducing Israel’s control over America is the weakened position of Netanyahu, under two Israeli court indictments for crimes, and by the destruction inflicted on Israel by its irresponsible attack on Iran, culminating in Netanyahu’s plea to Trump to stop the war before Israel had to sue for peace.
This leaves Trump with the upper hand. Israel now understands that it cannot exist without protection. Thus Trump can force Netanyahu to give up the unrealistic Zionist goal of Greater Israel and comply with Trump’s vision of a colony under America’s redevelopment of the Middle East.
If Trump would take this plan to the UN, it would silence Israel and the American neoconservative zionists and save us from war that could turn nuclear.
If Trump establishes peace and cooperation in the Middle East, he can do the same with the West and Russia. Russia was the ally of and in both WW I and WW II. It is not difficult to come to terms with a former ally. There is no ideological reason and no territorial reason for conflict between the West and Russia.
Think about America’s waste of resources and prestige during the first quarter of the 21st century. Trillions of dollars spend destroying Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Somalia with zero gain.
Let’s give Trump a chance. An American partnership in the Middle East is far better than the conflicts inherent in Greater Israel.`

        excerpt: "Iran doesn’t need a working uranium enrichment program to be a menace.",
        content: `So we did it. America’s military might -- a combination of satellite surveillance, stealth bombers, and enough firepower to make Zeus blush -- obliterated Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in a series of blistering airstrikes. The centrifuges are now molten metal. The command bunkers are smoking holes in the earth.
And, for a fleeting moment, the world exhaled.
But before we break out the cigars and declare Mission Accomplished 2.0, let’s remember: Iran doesn’t need a working uranium enrichment program to be a menace. In fact, Tehran’s most insidious weapons today don’t require any uranium at all -- just a keyboard and a decent broadband connection.
The question before us now is: What kind of actor will Iran be going forward, despite the ceasefire terms with America? Will it lick its wounds quietly? Or will it lean harder into the asymmetric warfare it has been perfecting for decades -- cyberthreats that can grind modern life to a halt without firing a single shot?
If the last decade has taught us anything, it’s that when nation-states get humiliated on the conventional battlefield, they don’t give up -- they pivot. Just look at Russia.
It’s naïve to think that, post-strike, Iran’s hackers will just fold up their laptops. More likely, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) will intensify cyber operations, targeting Israeli infrastructure and Western allies’ critical systems.
They just need vulnerabilities -- of which there are plenty.
It’s time to invest in cyber defense infrastructure with the urgency we’ve historically reserved for kinetic threats. That means hardening critical networks, funding AI-based threat detection, and creating real deterrence against state-backed cyberattacks.
After all, in this brave new world, the real weapons of mass destruction aren’t buried underground. They’re just one click away.`

        content: `In most democracies, a legislative speaker in power for more than three decades would be an anomaly, if not a scandal. In Lebanon, Nabih Berri’s uninterrupted rule over parliament since 1992 is treated as political furniture—imposing, immovable, and ultimately untouchable.
Now aged 87, Berri is more than a political survivor; he is a symbol of the entrenched, unaccountable elite that has overseen Lebanon’s descent into economic ruin, institutional collapse, and international irrelevance.
A lawyer by training and a warlord by origin, Berri rose to prominence during Lebanon’s civil war as head of the Amal Movement. Though originally a rival to Hezbollah, Berri long ago cemented an alliance with the Iran-backed group, together forming Lebanon’s dominant Shiite bloc.
If Hezbollah is the muscle, Amal is the mechanism—the party that manages the state from within, ensuring that key ministries and public contracts remain within loyalist hands.
For decades, he has cultivated a base in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, where loyalty is rewarded with public sector jobs and government contracts. Oversight is nonexistent; transparency, irrelevant.
According to a U.S. government source, officials in Washington increasingly view Berri’s unwavering alliance with Hezbollah as a serious impediment to Lebanon’s recovery. With frustration mounting, the administration is now considering targeted sanctions—not only against Berri himself, but also against his family members.
Lebanon is now a failed state in everything but name. Its currency has collapsed. Its institutions are hollow. Its elites are richer than ever. And its speaker of parliament—unchanged for 33 years—sits at the very heart of the wreckage.

        excerpt: "President Trump’s vision for the Middle East defined by commerce, not chaos...",
        content: `Watching President Trump speaking from Saudi Arabia, I almost felt sorry for a moment for our enemies. They must ponder how to stay relevant as the world seemingly metamorphizes before them, powerless to stop the transformation.
In his speech, President Trump said something so powerful yet unconventional that I had to stop and consider why he was the first leader of our country to say it:
Before our eyes, a new generation of leaders is transcending the ancient conflicts and tired divisions of the past and forging a future where the Middle East is defined by commerce, not chaos; where it exports technology, not terrorism; and where people of different nations, religions, and creeds are building cities together, not bombing each other.
Commerce is a recurring theme for Trump. His detractors miss the significance of exactly why commerce is so central to Trump’s vision of world peace. Trump sees dogma as static thinking that sees us imprisoned in a cage of a single acceptable outcome.
The world economy is on a path to bankruptcy, with almost no country putting debt management first. We reflexively return to the old solutions rather than look for an entirely new Rosetta Stone. That Rosetta Stone is about collective creation versus inevitable death through wealth and debt.
In other words, nations that depend on each other to be wealthy and prosperous rarely fight each other. The old Reagan dictum was “Peace through strength.” Trump would turn that around to “Peace through interdependent trade.”
We have a choice before us. Keep doing the things that are comfortable and familiar, or do something radically different, even if it may seem risky or untried.
Trump hasn’t named his plan, but the means and objectives are now clearly in sight. We should all wish him success because he is the captain of our Ship of State.`
